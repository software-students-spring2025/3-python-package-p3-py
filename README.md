# Python Package Exercise
# debugBuddy

## Description
#### debugBuddy is your emotional support companion when debugging code. We all know debugging can be frustrating, demoralizing, and sometimes downright infuriating. debugBuddy is designed to make those moments a little more bearable by providing:

* Motivational messages when you feel like giving up
* Practical debugging tips tailored to your experience level and problem type
* A rubber duck debugging experience that talks back
* Comforting responses to scary error messages

#### Unlike traditional debugging tools that focus solely on fixing technical issues, debugBuddy addresses the emotional and psychological aspects of debugging, helping you maintain sanity and motivation throughout the process.
